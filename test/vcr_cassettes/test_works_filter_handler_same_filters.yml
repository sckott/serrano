        projections of climate change under increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas
        levels are needed to evaluate the environmental cost of anthropogenic emissions,
        and to guide mitigation efforts. These projections are nowhere more important
        than Africa, with its high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and, in many
        regions, limited resources for adaptation. Climate models provide our best
        method for climate prediction but there are uncertainties in projections,
        especially on regional space scale. In Africa, limitations of observational
        networks add to this uncertainty since a crucial step in improving model projections
        is comparisons with observations. Exceeding uncertainties associated with
        climate model simulation are uncertainties due to projections of future emissions
        of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Humanity\u2019s choices in emissions pathways
        will have profound effects on climate, especially after the mid-century.<\/p><p>The
        African Sahel is a transition zone characterized by strong meridional precipitation
        and temperature gradients. Over West Africa, the Sahel marks the northernmost
        extent of the West African monsoon system. The region\u2019s climate is known
        to be sensitive to sea surface temperatures, both regional and global, as
        well as to land surface conditions. Increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases
        are already causing amplified warming over the Sahara Desert and, consequently,
        increased rainfall in parts of the Sahel. Climate model projections indicate
        that much of this increased rainfall will be delivered in the form of more
        intense storm systems.<\/p><p>The complicated and highly regional precipitation
        regimes of East Africa present a challenge for climate modeling. Within roughly
        5\u00ba of latitude of the equator, rainfall is delivered in two seasons\u2014the
        long rains in the spring, and the short rains in the fall. Regional climate
        model projections suggest that the long rains will weaken under greenhouse
        gas forcing, and the short rains season will extend farther into the winter
        months. Observations indicate that the long rains are already weakening.<\/p><p>Changes
        in seasonal rainfall over parts of subtropical southern Africa are observed,
        with repercussions and challenges for agriculture and water availability.
        Some elements of these observed changes are captured in model simulations
        of greenhouse gas-induced climate change, especially an early demise of the
        rainy season. The projected changes are quite regional, however, and more
        high-resolution study is needed. In addition, there has been very limited
        study of climate change in the Congo Basin and across northern Africa. Continued
        efforts to understand and predict climate using higher-resolution simulation
        must be sustained to better understand observed and projected changes in the
        physical processes that support African precipitation systems as well as the
        teleconnections that communicate remote forcings into the continent.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190228620.013.545","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,25]],"date-time":"2018-01-25T21:37:51Z","timestamp":1516916271000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Climate

        change adaptation is the ability of a society or a natural system to adjust
        to the (changing) conditions that support life in a certain climate region,
        including weather extremes in that region. The current discussion on climate
        change adaptation began in the 1990s, with the publication of the Assessment
        Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Since the
        beginning of the 21st century, most countries, and many regions and municipalities
        have started to develop and implement climate change adaptation strategies
        and plans. But since the implementation of adaptation measures must be planned
        and conducted at the local level, a major challenge is to actually implement
        adaptation to climate change in practice. One challenge is that scientific
        results are mainly published on international or national levels, and political
        guidelines are written at transnational (e.g., European Union), national,
        or regional levels\u2014these scientific results must be downscaled, interpreted,
        and adapted to local municipal or community levels. Needless to say, the challenges
        for implementation are also rooted in a large number of uncertainties, from
        long time spans to matters of scale, as well as in economic, political, and
        social interests. From a human perspective, climate change impacts occur rather
        slowly, while local decision makers are engaged with daily business over much
        shorter time spans.<\/p><p>Among the obstacles to implementing adaptation
        measures to climate change are three major groups of uncertainties: (a) the
        uncertainties surrounding the development of our future climate, which include
        the exact climate sensitivity of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the
        reliability of emission scenarios and underlying storylines, and inherent
        uncertainties in climate models; (b) uncertainties about anthropogenically
        induced climate change impacts (e.g., long-term sea level changes, changing
        weather patterns, and extreme events); and (c) uncertainties about the future
        development of socioeconomic and political structures as well as legislative
        frameworks.<\/p><p>Besides slow changes, such as changing sea levels and vegetation
        zones, extreme events (natural hazards) are a factor of major importance.
        Many societies and their socioeconomic systems are not properly adapted to
        their current climate zones (e.g., intensive agriculture in dry zones) or
        to extreme events (e.g., housing built in flood-prone areas). Adaptation measures
        can be successful only by gaining common societal agreement on their necessity
        and overall benefit. Ideally, climate change adaptation measures are combined
        with disaster risk reduction measures to enhance resilience on short, medium,
        and long time scales.<\/p><p>The role of uncertainties and time horizons is
        addressed by developing climate change adaptation measures on community level
        and in close cooperation with local actors and stakeholders, focusing on strengthening
        resilience by addressing current and emerging vulnerability patterns. Successful
        adaptation measures are usually achieved by developing \u201cno-regret\u201d
        measures, in other words\u2014measures that have at least one function of
        immediate social and\/or economic benefit as well as long-term, future benefits.
        To identify socially acceptable and financially viable adaptation measures
        successfully, it is useful to employ participatory tools that give all involved
        parties and decision makers the possibility to engage in the process of identifying
        adaptation measures that best fit collective needs.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190228620.013.635","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,2,28]],"date-time":"2017-02-28T07:42:58Z","timestamp":1488267778000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Climate

        discussions of climate often suggested that it caused societies to have certain
        qualities. In the 19th-century, imperial representations of the world environment
        frequently \u201cdetermined\u201d the fate of peoples and places, a practice
        that has frequently been used to explain the largest patterns of political
        rivalry and the fates of empires and their struggles for dominance in world
        politics. In the 21st century, climate change has mostly reversed the causal
        logic in the reasoning about human\u2013nature relationships and their geographies.
        The new thinking suggests that human decisions, at least those made by the
        rich and powerful with respect to the forms of energy that are used to power
        the global economy, are influencing future climate changes. Humans are now
        shaping the environment on a global scale, not the other way around. Despite
        the widespread acceptance of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate-change action,
        numerous arguments about who should act and how they should do so to deal
        with climate change shape international negotiations. Differing viewpoints
        are in part a matter of geographical location and whether an economy is dependent
        on fossil-fuels revenue or subject to increasingly severe storms, droughts,
        or rising sea levels. These differences have made climate negotiations very
        difficult in the last couple of decades. Partly in response to these differences,
        the Paris Agreement devolves primary responsibility for climate policy to
        individual states rather than establish any other geopolitical arrangement.
        Apart from the outright denial that humanity is a factor in climate change,
        arguments about whether climate change causes conflict and how security policies
        should engage climate change also partly shape contemporary geopolitical agendas.
        Despite climate-change deniers, in the Trump administration in particular,
        in the aftermath of the Paris Agreement, climate change is understood increasingly
        as part of a planetary transformation that has been set in motion by industrial
        activity and the rise of a global fossil-fuel-powered economy. But this is
        about more than just climate change. The larger earth-system science discussion
        of transformation, which can be encapsulated in the use of the term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d
        for the new geological circumstances of the biosphere, is starting to shape
        the geopolitics of climate change just as new political actors are beginning
        to have an influence on climate politics.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190228620.013.642","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,25]],"date-time":"2017-09-25T22:43:17Z","timestamp":1506379397000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Climate

        events express the dynamics of the Earth\u2019s oceans and atmosphere, but
        are profoundly personal and social in their impacts, representation and comprehension.
        This paper explores how knowledge of the climate has multiple scales and dimensions
        that intersect in our experience of the climate. The climate is objective
        and subjective, scientific and cultural, local and global, and personal and
        political. These divergent dimensions of the climate frame the philosophical
        and cultural challenges of a dynamic climate. Drawing on research into the
        adaptation in Australia\u2019s Murray Darling Basin, this paper outlines the
        significance of understanding the cultural dimensions of the changing climate.
        This paper argues for greater recognition of the ways in which cultures co-create
        the climate and, therefore, that the climate needs to be recognised as a socio-natural
        hybrid. Given the climate\u2019s hybrid nature, research should aim to integrate
        our understanding of the social and the natural dimensions of our relationships
        to a changing climate.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/cli9040063","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]],"date-time":"2021-04-12T07:04:06Z","timestamp":1618211046000},"page":"63","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["How

        the last decade, scholars have devoted significant attention to making climate
        change communication more effective but less attention to ensuring that it
        is ethical. This neglect risks blurring the distinction between persuasion
        and manipulation, generating distrust among audiences, and obscuring the conceptual
        resources needed to guide communicators.<\/p><p>Three prevailing approaches
        to moral philosophy can illuminate various ethical considerations involved
        in communicating climate change. <italic>Consequentialism<\/italic>, which
        evaluates actions as morally right or wrong according to their consequences,
        is the implicit moral framework shared by many social scientists and policymakers
        interested in climate change. While consequentialism rightly emphasizes the
        consequences of communication, its exclusive focus on the effectiveness of
        communication tends to obscure other moral considerations, such as what communicators
        owe to audiences as a matter of duty or respect. <italic>Deontology<\/italic>
        better captures these duties and provides grounds for communicating in ways
        that respect the rights of citizens to deliberate and decide how to act. But
        because deontology tends to cast ethics as an abstract set of universalizable
        principles, it often downplays the virtues of character needed to motivate
        action and apply principles across a variety of contexts. <italic>Virtue ethics<\/italic>
        seeks to overcome the limits of both consequentialism and deontology by focusing
        on the virtues that individuals and communities need to flourish. While virtue
        ethics is often criticized for failing to provide a concrete blueprint for
        action, its conception of moral development and thick vocabulary of virtues
        and vices offer a robust set of practical and conceptual resources for guiding
        the actions, attitudes, and relationships that characterize climate change
        communication. Ultimately, all three approaches highlight moral considerations
        that should inform the ethics of communicating climate change.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190228620.013.564","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,28]],"date-time":"2016-09-28T14:58:22Z","timestamp":1475074702000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Ethics
