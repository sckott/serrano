        study aims to determine students'' experiences with comprehensive reading
        strategies using Wattpad. This study uses a qualitative descriptive research
        method. Data are collected using interviews, observation, documentation, and
        questionnaires. The analysis of this research uses a triangulation technique
        which consists of steps; data reduction, data display, and ultimately conclusion
        to analyze the data. The results of this study indicate that extensive reading
        through Wattpad can be used for pleasure, extensive reading through the Wattpad
        platform can reduce stress, extensive reading through Wattpad can increase
        motivation, and extensive reading through Wattpad can increase vocabulary.
        All of these activities can have a positive impact on students. Plus, Wattpad''s
        platform is great for in-depth reading. Therefore, one of the best ways to
        learn English is to read extensively on the Wattpad platform. Teachers should
        realize that because Wattpad is a practical reading tool that can be accessed
        anywhere and at any time, all the stories students read must be age-appropriate.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.37680\/qalamuna.v14i2.3308","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,10]],"date-time":"2023-10-10T23:56:30Z","timestamp":1696982190000},"page":"423-432","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The
