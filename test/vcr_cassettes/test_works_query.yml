        is perhaps the most important, but least formally discussed, aspect of current
        ecological research and teaching. The last twenty years has demonstrated that
        this is no longer a viable approach and the rise of climate change research,
        and its concomitant denial, has brought disagreement and outright refusal
        to accept facts to the research community and the wider world. This has, in
        turn, produced a vigorous research community aimed specifically at challenging
        false ideas and getting accurate science fully embedded into the public sphere.
        What is less common is an exploration of the parameters surrounding communication
        and the outputs of discourse. Ecology suffers from exactly the same problems
        as climate science but without the mass of research exploring the issues and
        potential solutions. The aim of this article is to propose a model of communication
        and outline the key factors involved as well as point toward some solutions.
        As far as can be ascertained, there is no model of ecological communication
        extant. Some research has put forward some elements but it is far from comprehensive.
        It became obvious that using a systems model would provide the base needed.
        Research starts with gathering data (input), working on that data (processing),
        and producing an end product that people can see\/use (output). At this stage,
        the model can be left as it is because it follows the usual route of current
        research (as exemplified by academia, for example). However, it was proposed,
        early on, to broaden this remit. The original goal was to explore how information
        can be distorted between production and (often multiple chains of) users and
        how such distortion might be ameliorated. This started in climate science
        but has recently moved to ecology. Thus, the final iteration of the proposed
        model consists of four parts. The first is the creation of a product\u2014usually
        research project and associated data. This aspect is subject to a range of
        political and logistical biases thus ensuring that the aim of studying all
        aspects of ecology is unlikely to be achieved. From here, data go into the
        process of being prepared for publication. Again, a series of forces control
        and constrain what is able to be later communicated. This ranges from philosophical
        and ideological limitations through to political and sociological filters.
        Cognition plays a key part not only in interpreting data but also introducing
        bias (deliberate or otherwise) into the results. From there, the move is to
        publish. Consumers take material from a range of media who may, or may not,
        have allowed publication. It is also the place where research output gets
        a wider airing and where further misinterpretation can be found. Normally,
        this would feed back into initial product stage but here the aim is to create
        a fourth division, a precursor, that argues that by studying issues in ecological
        communication, adaptations can be made to make it more effective and less
        prone to mis\/disinformation. The aim here is to provide a practical element
        to assist improvement of ecological communication.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0238","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,25]],"date-time":"2022-07-25T14:38:07Z","timestamp":1658759887000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Communicating

        is a world of sights and sounds. We live by our eyes and ears and tend generally
        to be oblivious to the chemical happenings in our surrounds. Such happenings
        are ubiquitous. All organisms engender chemical signals, and all, in their
        respective ways, respond to the chemical emissions of others. The result is
        a vast communicative interplay, fundamental to the fabric of life\u201d (Eisner
        and Meinwald 1995, p. v), cited under General Overviews). Chemical ecology
        is the study of ecological interactions between organisms mediated by chemicals
        produced by those organisms. Chemical interactions between organisms can be
        analyzed across all organizational levels, reaching from cell-cell interaction
        and intraspecific and multitrophic-level interactions to whole community interactions
        and environmental ecological processes. Because of their ubiquity, chemical
        signals that carry information (semiochemicals) can be categorized by the
        types of ecological interactions they mediate, such as intraspecific social
        communication, antagonistic interactions, and mutualism. Accordingly, this
        article is organized into three core areas, one formed by the chemicals mediating
        interactions between members of the same species (pheromones), and the others
        by interspecific interactions involving allomones (where the sender benefits),
        and synomones (where both sender and receivers benefit). A fourth group of
        signals, kairomones (where the receiver benefits), can comprise all other
        signal categories when they are perceived and utilized by a third organism
        that itself gains a benefit from eavesdropping on communication between others.
        While primary studies in chemical ecology focused on the identification of
        compounds mediating interactions between organisms, today\u2019s debates are
        dominated by micro- and macroevolutionary aspects of chemical interactions.
        The very rapid growth of the chemical ecology literature over recent decades
        has been, in part, driven by the growing appreciation of the high economic
        value of understanding chemical communication, reaching from applications
        in pest management over the control of disease vectors in agriculture to the
        use of chemical signals in medicine. Moreover, the field has dramatically
        profited from innovations in analytical chemistry, making the separation of
        complex compound mixtures as well as the identification of compound structures
        efficient and accessible to a broader community of researchers. Recent advances
        in molecular ecology have aided an even more rapid mechanistic and functional
        analysis of semiochemicals, leading to a modern consolidation of different
        research fields. This collection of significant publications focuses on the
        functional and evolutionary analysis of chemical signals important in mediating
        ecological interactions. Moreover, attention has been given to publications
        that provide conceptual frameworks and are among the most highly cited in
        the respective subdisciplines. They can thus provide a good introduction for
        the interested reader and allow efficient forward and backward searching for
        more detailed information.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0023","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Chemical

        ecology is a branch of study and thinking within the ecological sciences that
        focuses on the ecosystem\u2014a dynamic network of interactions of organisms
        and their environment\u2014and the importance of these interactions to the
        organisms and earth system processes. The discipline represents one of two
        different epistemological approaches within ecology that emerged in the 20th
        century: a species-centric community-based approach, and a process-centric
        ecosystem-based approach. Both approaches study the ways in which species
        interact among themselves and their environment, share a common language,
        and share a common set of principles. The community-based approach focuses
        on how species\u2019 distributions and abundances are shaped by their resource
        needs and tolerances to environmental conditions, and by their interactions
        with other species. The ecosystem-based approach represents a significant
        departure in that it considers both the resource needs and tolerances of species
        and their interactions with other species, but also factors in the contributions
        that species make to earth system processes (e.g., biogeochemical cycles,
        climate). The two perspectives are not as mutually exclusive as the phrasing
        of the approaches suggests, but rather offer different approaches to how we
        view the environment and communities and the factors that regulate them. In
        the 21st century, modern ecosystem science includes the influences that humans
        have as part of ecological communities and as drivers of change in ecological
        communities. This linkage within the ecosystem perspective of biology affecting
        the physical environment, and the recent developments that include the social
        and human dimensions, has positioned the approach as a critical one in understanding
        the relationship among global processes and the services that ecosystems provide
        to human well-being that is embodied in the emerging science of sustainability.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0202","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,28]],"date-time":"2018-08-28T09:14:08Z","timestamp":1535447648000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecosystem

        natural disturbance agents include wildfire, wind, landslides, snow avalanches,
        volcanoes, flooding, and other weather-related phenomena. Fire is of particular
        interest because of its antiquity, its natural role in many terrestrial ecosystems,
        its long-term use by humans to modify vegetation, and its potentially serious
        threat to life and property. Fire ecology is the art and science of understanding
        natural and human fire history and fire effects on the environment, species,
        ecosystems, and landscapes. This knowledge aids the development of fire and
        ecosystem management plans and activities. Fire history is determined by a
        number of techniques that use available physical or cultural evidence to examine
        particular temporal and spatial scales. Fire effects on the environment and
        organisms are determined by observation and experimentation, but the findings
        are variable and often contradictory. Fire regimes are used to characterize
        the role of fire in specific ecosystems and can help guide ecosystem restoration
        activities. Attitudes toward fire have evolved over time, as good and bad
        experiences combined with improved scientific understanding to influence our
        perspectives. Natural disturbances came to be viewed as integral parts of
        ecosystems rather than external perturbations. We now strive to allow fire
        to maintain its natural role in wilderness areas and parks and also to emulate
        natural disturbances, such as fire, when designing forest harvesting operations.

        ecology is a rapidly developing subdiscipline of ecology concerned with how
        species interactions and abiotic components of the environment affect patterns
        and processes of disease. To date, disease ecology has focused largely on
        infectious disease. The scientific study of infectious disease has a long
        history dominated by specialists on the taxa of infectious agents (e.g., bacteriologists,
        virologists), mechanisms of host defense (e.g., immunologists), effects of
        infection on individual hosts (e.g., pathologists), effects on host populations
        (epidemiologists), and treatment (e.g., practicing physicians and veterinarians).
        Disease ecology arose as scientists increasingly recognized that the interactions
        between pathogen and host could be conceptually united with other interspecific
        interactions, such as those between predator and prey, competitors, or mutualists.
        At its simplest, an infectious disease consists of an interaction between
        one species of pathogen and one species of host. The evolution of disease
        ecology since the late 20th century has incorporated additional layers of
        complexity, including recognition that most pathogens infect multiple species
        of host, that hosts are infected with multiple pathogens, and that abiotic
        conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture) interact with biotic conditions to
        affect transmission and disease. As a consequence, a framework broader than
        the simplest host-pathogen system is often required to understand disease
        dynamics. Disease ecologists are interested both in the ecological causes
        of disease patterns (for instance, how the population density of a host influences
        transmission rates), and the ecological consequences of disease (for instance,
        how the population dynamics of a host species change as an epidemic progresses).
        Consequently, disease ecology today often integrates across several levels
        of biological organization, from molecular mechanisms of pathology and immunity;
        to individual-organism changes in health, survival, and reproduction; to population
        dynamics of hosts and pathogens; to community dynamics of hosts and pathogens;
        to impacts of disease on ecosystem processes; to ecosystem-level effects of
        climate change and landscape change on disease.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0128","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,3]],"date-time":"2015-02-03T11:57:47Z","timestamp":1422964667000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Disease

        the beginning of the 20th century there was much debate about the \u201cnature\u201d
        of communities. The driving question was whether the community was a self-organized
        system of co-occurring species or simply a haphazard collection of populations
        with minimal functional integration. At that time, two extreme views dominated
        the discussion: one view considered a community as a superorganism, the member
        species of which were tightly bound together by interactions that contributed
        to repeatable patterns of species abundance in space and time. This concept
        led to the assumption that communities are fundamental entities, to be classified
        as the Linnaean taxonomy of species. Frederick E. Clements was one of the
        leading proponents of this approach, and his view became known as the organismic
        concept of communities. This assumes a common evolutionary history for the
        integrated species. The opposite view was the individualistic continuum concept,
        advocated by H.\u00a0A. Gleason. His focus was on the traits of individual
        species that allow each to live within specific habitats or geographical ranges.
        In this view a community is an assemblage of populations of different species
        whose traits allow persisting in a prescribed area. The spatial boundaries
        are not sharp, and the species composition can change considerably. Consequently,
        it was discussed whether ecological communities were sufficiently coherent
        entities to be considered appropriate study objects. Later, consensus was
        reached: that properties of communities are of central interest in ecology,
        regardless of their integrity and coherence. From the 1950s and 1960s onward,
        the discussion was dominated by the deterministic outcome of local interactions
        between species and their environments and the building of this into models
        of communities. This approach, indicated as \u201ctraditional community ecology,\u201d
        led to a morass of theoretical models, without being able to provide general
        principles about many-species communities. Early-21st-century approaches to
        bringing general patterns into community ecology concern (1) the metacommunity
        approach, (2) the functional trait approach, (3) evolutionary community ecology,
        and (4) the four fundamental processes. The metacommunity approach implicitly
        recognizes and studies the important role of spatiotemporal dynamics. In the
        functional trait approach, four themes are focused upon: traits, environmental
        gradients, the interaction milieu, and performance currencies. This functional,
        trait-focused approach should have a better prospect of understanding the
        effects of global changes. Evolutionary community ecology is an approach in
        which the combination of community ecology and evolutionary biology will lead
        to a better understanding of the complexity of communities and populations.
        The four fundamental processes are selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal.
        This approach concerns an organizational scheme for community ecology, based
        on these four processes to describe all existing specific models and frameworks,
        in order to make general statements about process\u2013pattern connections.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0042","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Community

        have become an urban species, but this is a rather recent phenomena. The first
        cities appeared around six thousand years ago and while their number increased,
        their population remained relatively small. This changed in the industrial
        revolution and today cities are home to more than 50 percent of the world\u2019s
        human population. Considering that most people live in cities and that ecology
        has been around for more than one hundred years, it seems obvious to have
        a subdiscipline called urban ecology. Not until the 1960s and 1970s, however,
        did urban ecology fully emerge and not until the 1990s did it become wildly
        popular. Most ecologists shunned urban areas, which have traditionally been
        viewed in opposition to natural, pristine, and wilderness places. It is true
        enough that water, air, and soil in cities are often polluted, open spaces
        are scarce and heavily managed, and communities resemble a wild mix of native
        and non-native species. It took a while until ecologists perceived this not
        just as a mess, but also as a research opportunity for understanding key ecological
        principles. Such principles are treated in separate Oxford Bibliographies
        in Ecology articles \u201cCompetition and Coexistence in Animal Communities,\u201d
        \u201cMetapopulations and Spatial Population Processes,\u201d \u201cIsland

        The study of these phenomena is often referred to as ecology in cities. In
        the 1970s, a broader, interdisciplinary perspective took hold. It is often
        referred to as ecology of cities and understands urban areas as social-ecological
        systems. This shift in perspective stemmed from a recognition that people
        are influencing ecosystems everywhere on earth. In fact, cities are at the
        heart of many environmental problems and, therefore, they are a good place
        to look for solutions. Today, urban ecology is a key discipline for an urban
        planet. The need to adapt cities to climate change, maintain vegetation in
        the face of climate extremes, balance the need for development with the need
        for green space, or decrease the negative local-to-global environmental impacts
        of cities can be achieved without the interdisciplinary perspective urban
        ecology provides. This article gives an overview of the ever-increasing urban
        ecology literature. Of course, the list is subjective, reflecting our academic

        is a condition in which the terrestrial surface, streams, rivers, lakes, and
        wetlands can no longer hold the discharge of water, and the excess water spreads
        out to the adjoining structures. Often such spreads bring ecological, environmental,
        economic, and societal destruction and disaster. Therefore flooding, as one
        of the major destructive natural disturbances in general, comes with a negative

        ecological point of view, low to mild natural flooding (\u201cregular flooding\u201d)
        is a natural process in many terrestrial and transition zones (e.g., coastal

        and physics have borrowed ideas and techniques from each other for a long
        time. The archetypal example is the concept of Brownian motion, coined after
        the botanist Robert Brown who, in 1827, observed grains of pollen suspended
        in water undergoing jittering movement. It was this jittering and unpredictable
        movement that led Karl Pearson in 1905 to coin the name random walk which
        led to the first model of migration for biological organisms in his seminal
        contribution, A Mathematical Theory of Random Migration in 1906. The explanation
        of the observations by Robert Brown had to wait until Einstein\u2019s formulation
        of diffusion in 1905, and its experimental validation by Perrin in 1909, which
        ultimately led to the acceptance in the physics community of the molecular
        nature of physical reality. Since then, the diffusion or random walk paradigm
        has been a workhorse of movement modeling in most, if not all, areas of ecology.
        While this example clearly shows that ecology and physics have had an illustrious
        entangled past, it is the second half of the 20th century that has witnessed
        an increasing number of collaborations between practitioners from the two
        fields. The interactions bridging the gaps between ecology and physics have
        been fruitful in multiple ways, both empirically and theoretically. While
        instrumentations for ecological applications have naturally profited from
        advances in experimental physics, e.g., biosensors, imaging technologies,
        and tracking devices, theoretical physics has provided modeling approaches
        and quantitative tools to help tackle both theoretical and applied problems
        in ecology. More generally, physics methodologies have instilled a way of
        thinking characterized by the search for spatial and temporal scales that
        are critical to the system, by the quest to differentiate between the deterministic
        and the random forces at play, by the need to relate mathematical descriptions
        in terms of microscopic, mesoscopic, or macroscopic perspectives, and by exploring
        the links between population level phenomena and the interaction events of
        the underlying individuals. Examples of such an approach include the study
        of the order\/disorder phase transitions in collective animal behavior, the
        application of renormalization group ideas to landscape ecology, and the identification
        of scaling properties of transportation networks to analyze the characteristic
        quarter power relations in allometry. Underlying these and other examples
        is the belief that in living systems general or universal quantitative laws
        can be captured by a coarse-grained description of their most salient features.
        This very aspect is what has often made a physics approach to ecology controversial.
        While it is inevitable that simple theories have limitations, when they quantify
        and explain key characteristics of a process, they have much merit. They in
        fact provide the foundational ground from where to understand the full complexity
        of nature. Over the last forty years a vast literature of methodologies from
        theoretical physics have been applied to ecology. In some instances, they
        have provided a solid quantitative basis to an already developed body of literature,
        and in other instances they have opened up new perspectives and ideas. The
        sections below recount some of these ideas with citations made either to the
        original contributions or to review articles where research findings on a
        topic are synthetized and systematized, the focus being though on theoretical
        developments rather than empirical ones. The article also aims, predominantly,
        to identify distinct contributions from physics rather than the much broader
        applied mathematics community.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0249","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,25]],"date-time":"2023-10-25T12:49:35Z","timestamp":1698238175000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Ecology

        systems, grass-like vegetation interacting with their large mammal grazers,
        are important globally, where estimates of their potential extent (depending
        on classifications) range from 30 to 70 percent of the terrestrial land surface
        and show a major presence on five continents. In grasslands and savanna ecosystems,
        the grazing energy channel is prominent (~50 percent of energy flows through
        herbivores), unlike energy flow in more arid ecosystems where the detrital
        energy channel predominates. While variable, estimates of consumption of above-ground
        net primary productivity (ANPP) by native large mammal herbivores ranges from
        1 (desert grassland) to ~64 percent (mesic grasslands), and cattle remove

        Consequently, in addition to altered aboveground biomass, one expects significant
        system responses to grazers, including altered plant community species composition,
        changed plant morphology and population structure, impacted nutrient cycles,
        and altered habitat structure in turn affecting animal species distributions
        both native and exotic. Examples of each of these responses are provided in
        this article. Our bibliography takes a decidedly grazer-centric view. Topics
        in grazing ecology are wide ranging, where both plant and grazer responses
        are studied as we attempt to integrate the many moving parts operating at
        multiple scales to understand responses from multiple perspectives. These
        include an understanding of the role of disturbances (fire, drought, herbivory),
        internal dynamics driving fire-grazer interactions, variable environmental
        conditions (especially primary production and rainfall), resource heterogeneity
        at multiple spatial scales, variable herbivore body size, different digestive
        physiologies of herbivores, sedentary presence and migratory movement of large
        mammalian herbivores in response to variable environmental conditions, and
        trophic control of food webs including bottom-up\/top-down regulation with
        important roles for direct and indirect species interactions. Combined, many
        factors contribute to a range of equilibrial and nonequilibrial interpretations
        of key responses and patterns of grazing ecology with important implications
        for management and conservation of these systems worldwide. Much of grazing
        ecology focuses on the interactions of large mammal herbivores with vegetation
        structure and plant communities. Much less is known about invertebrate grazers,
        although they can be important participants as well. This article deals primarily
        with vertebrate grazers, factors affecting grazing dynamics, and examples

        ecosystems comprise only 3\u20135 percent of the world\u2019s land surface,
        but their unique habitats and specialized and rare species have garnered the
        attention of biologists for centuries. The use of wetlands in Europe and Asia
        has a deep history, as draining peat bogs, marshes, mires, and swamps for
        fuel, timber, and agricultural crops was common practice. The first academic
        use of the word wetlands appears in Catesby\u2019s 1754 book The Natural History
        of Carolina, Florida and the Bahamas Islands, and early studies of wetlands
        focused on the distinct flora and fauna found in these ecosystems, with a
        particular emphasis on waterfowl, fish, or other game. Illustrating this point
        is the first major assessment and classification of wetlands across the United
        States in 1956, which is solely based on waterfowl habitat value. Research
        on wetlands quickly evolved in the 1960s and 1970s to become a distinct subdiscipline
        of the burgeoning field of ecology. Fueled by the concept of wetlands as \u201cMother
        Nature\u2019s kidneys,\u201d and by their potential for cheap wastewater treatment,
        there was an initial focus on their biogeochemical and hydrologic functions
        on the landscape, as well as the nutrient removal or transformation services
        they provided. Research in both Europe and the United States also focused
        on how plants and animals survived the alternating wet\/dry soil regimes wetlands
        possessed and demonstrated that wide-ranging soil redox conditions were microbial
        driven and produced either reduced or oxidized chemical ions, often with toxic
        or altered properties, depending on the presence or absence of oxygen and
        alternate electron acceptors like nitrate or iron. These findings led to a
        number of elegant studies focusing on the ecophysiology of how wetland plants
        and animals survived anaerobic conditions, the presence of toxic chemicals,
        and saline conditions found in coastal marshes. Since the 1990s, research
        has focused more on biogeochemical cycling in wetlands, especially nitrogen,
        phosphorus, and, more recently, carbon flux and storage as it relates to global
        climate change, as it became understood that wetland soils are globally important
        stores of carbon and sources of atmospheric methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
        Thus, global warming effects on boreal and tropical wetlands and continued
        drainage of these ecosystems worldwide have become a major area of concern,
        along with the effects of sea level rise on coastal wetland survival. To offset
        these losses, the fields of wetland restoration and ecologic economics have
        become increasing relevant.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0220","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,31]],"date-time":"2019-07-31T07:27:24Z","timestamp":1564558044000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Wetland

        events (such as lightning strikes or floods) occur commonly in nature. In
        ecology, random events that can affect population and community dynamics are
        called stochastic processes. Although ecologists recognize that stochastic
        processes occur, their importance in shaping populations and communities has
        been controversial. Determining when and how stochastic processes are important
        ecologically is critical for predicting extinction events or responses to
        climate change and explaining tropical biodiversity. Many population dynamics
        appears to be stochastic, particularly when the environment fluctuates or
        the population is small. For example, environmental variation that can reduce
        population size can increase the likelihood of stochastic extinction, because
        a small population is prone to go extinct due to random fluctuation in population
        size. Chance colonization and random order of immigration\/emigration can
        influence the dynamics of populations and communities if early-arriving species
        outcompete later-arriving species. Stochastic processes can also create environmental
        fluctuations that favor species that could otherwise go extinct, if such fluctuations
        can allow for coexistence when species benefit from different environmental
        conditions. Modern ecologists generally agree that dynamics of populations
        and communities have both deterministic and stochastic components that operate
        simultaneously.

        ecology (IE) tracks physical resource flows of industrial and consumer systems
        at a variety of spatial scales, drawing on environmental and social science,
        engineering, management, and policy analysis. Prescriptively, IE seeks to
        reduce environmental impacts and the pressure on natural resources while maintaining
        function for human well-being, by stressing the importance of production choices
        to extend the life of embedded materials and energy, emphasizing circular
        rather than linear flows, and decoupling economic growth from resource use.
        IE has been described as a \u201cpost-modern science\u201d that synthesizes
        multiple perspectives in theory and problem solving, often simultaneously,
        as a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary field. The
        unusual name \u201cindustrial ecology\u201d derives from a metaphor with the
        biological ecosystem and borrows on several fronts, such as its focus on resource
        cycling, multi-scalar systems, material and energy stocks and flows, and food
        webs. Over time concepts from other sciences have also been weaved into industrial
        ecology. The intellectual roots of industrial ecology date back to the 19th
        century, and some seminal methods were published in the 1960s and 1970s. It
        took until the early 1990s, however, before a scientific field began to take
        shape. Since its early days, industrial ecology has become more robust through
        database development, deeper mathematical modeling, collaboration among natural,
        physical, and social scientists, and extension of theory on its own and in
        dialogue with other allied fields. At the same time, industrial ecology increasingly
        contributes insights to environmental management and policy, on issues ranging
        from climate change, to biodiversity loss, water, and more. Despite its youth,
        breadth, and intersection with other disciplines, industrial ecology can lay
        claim to several subfields as being within its ambit: industrial symbiosis,
        which studies the exchange of byproducts and sharing of resources among industrial
        actors; socioeconomic metabolism and material flows analysis, focusing on
        the stocks and flows of various materials through society; life-cycle assessment,
        examining the environmental impact of a material, product, or system across
        its entire life cycle; environmental input-output analysis, broadly focused
        on the environmental impact of entire sectors of the economy; sustainable
        urban systems, with focus on metabolism of resources at the urban scale; and
        resource productivity and circular economy, addressing the effectiveness of
        resource use while decreasing its impact. In addition to these core subfields,
        other topics are more loosely linked with industrial ecology, including green
        chemistry, life-cycle engineering, social ecology, design for environment,
        and ecological economics.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0200","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,28]],"date-time":"2018-03-28T14:31:57Z","timestamp":1522247517000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Industrial

        Himalayan region, spanning Bhutan, Nepal, northern India, Pakistan, and the
        Tibet Autonomous Region, may be defined by its mountainous geography, but
        it is characterized by tremendous ecological diversity. This diversity results
        from the altitude, slope, and aspect of the mountains and complex glaciology
        and hydrology as well as the climate and the micro-climates that the range
        itself shapes. It is evident in alpine pastures and fertile valleys; high
        altitude deserts and montane; temperate, tropical, and subtropical forests;
        grasslands; and glacial lake and river systems. The ecological diversity of
        the region is matched by that of its human communities, which adhere to a
        range of religious beliefs and cultural practices and pursue complex livelihood
        strategies. Understanding this relationship\u2014between people and the environment\u2014has
        been an enduring theme in studies of Himalayan ecology. Some scholarship takes
        the Himalayan region as an important site in which to learn how human communities

        study of soil ecology has a long tradition. Most of this interest, until relatively
        recently, has been from an agricultural perspective, but now it is widely
        accepted that soil ecology is central to the study of terrestrial ecology.
        Early research in soil ecology was largely descriptive, detailing the abundance
        of diversity of organisms in soils of different habitats. However, interest
        in functional soil ecology started in the 1980s with studies of trophic interactions
        in soil and their importance for nutrient cycles and decomposition. Now, the
        topic has blossomed, with the help of new technologies that allow the study
        of soil organisms and their activities in situ, and there is currently widespread
        recognition that soil ecology is fundamental to our understanding of the functioning
        of terrestrial ecosystems and their response to global change. Today, the
        field of soil ecology is dominated by discussions on the use of new molecular
        tools that enable ecologists to understand what regulates patterns of diversity
        in soil, the functional role of soil biodiversity and plant-soil interactions,
        especially those that occur at the root-soil interface, and the role of soil
        biological communities in regulating ecosystem responses to global change,
        including the global carbon cycle under climate change. Many challenges still
        remain in soil ecology, and perhaps the most significant is the need for a
        stronger theoretical basis for the subject; almost all studies in this area
        have been carried out from an empirical perspective, and modeling approaches
        are still in their infancy. As a consequence, our ability to make predictions
        about the role of soil biological interactions and feedbacks in regulating
        terrestrial ecosystem processes and their response to global change remains
        limited.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/obo\/9780199830060-0067","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,19]],"date-time":"2013-03-19T18:17:08Z","timestamp":1363717028000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Soil

        population ecology comprises the study of the growth, regulation, and interactions
        of animal populations. As a level of organization, the population comes between
        individuals on the one hand and communities on the other, but there is not
        a sharp distinction between those phenomena that affect the levels above and
        below from those of the population: a population\u2019s growth may be much
        effected by the behavior of its constituent individuals, while the presence
        of predators, prey, and competitors in the community will likewise have important
        effects on the population. Nonetheless, the population is a worthy area of
        emphasis (for greater consideration of multispecies interactions and other
        aspects of community structure and function, see the separate Oxford Bibliographies
        article \u201cCommunity Ecology\u201d). Animals share a number of relevant
        ecological features that make a separation from plants useful: animals are
        all heterotrophs, mostly exist as biologically separate and genetically distinct
        individuals, and most are sexual. There are greater or lesser exceptions to
        all of these features, but they unify the phenomena of animal populations,
        and make counting individuals an intuitive and practical way of accounting
        for their populations\u2019 growth and numbers. That part of ecology that
